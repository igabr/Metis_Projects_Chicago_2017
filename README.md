This repository contains all the projects I completed during the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.

Thie repository represents a portfolio of data science work.

I was with Metis during the Summer of 2017. After Metis, I returned to complete my final year in [Graduate School](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) @ The University of Chicago.
